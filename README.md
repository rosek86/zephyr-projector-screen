# Matter accessory for projector+screen setup

The repository is an attempt to use nRF52840 dongle as a Matter accessory to turn on/off projector using IR remote, and driving motorized screen up and down. 

Matter accessory firmware is large in flash memory footprint, and it requires additional flash memory which is not available in nRF52840 dongle design. I decided to manufacture small addon, with flash memory and 3 JST sockets as a base for this and similar projects in the future.
